description: The data created by the project will be published as Linked Data to guarantee interoperability with other historical research data from the cultural heritage sector, that are also part of the Linked Data Cloud. As a historical source, heraldic imagery never occures isolated, but is always integrated into a specific context of usage, display and material realization. These contexts are highly significant for the understanding and interpretation of coats of arms in their meaning for historical societies. Therefore, such source-specific contexts have to be preserved in the data. This will give the data a maximum of reusibility, sustainability while also making them verifiable in research environments.
