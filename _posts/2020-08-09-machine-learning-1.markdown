description: The project employs machine learning methods to detect heraldic imagery. With a trained model of retinanet, vast quantities of image files - ranging from scans of handwritten manuscripts to photographs of glass paintings in churches - can be automatically checked for occurances of coats of arms. The method will be refined by using capsule networks to identify the single pictorial elements of coats of arms, thereby differentiating them furhter. In this way, we will not only able to build up a huge database of coats of arms in visual historical sources, but also to get a better understaning of the developement and spread of heraldic imagery in specific contexts of use, while also enhancing capsule networks as a technology.
